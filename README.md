# Text Storage Smart Contract and DApp

A simple smart contract and DApp written for the Ethereum blockchain that stores text.
Initial motivation was to store a resume on-chain. Any user with a web3 enabled browser may view 
the resume in the blockchain, but only the creator of the contract may make updates
to the stored text.
